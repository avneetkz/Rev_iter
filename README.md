# Rev_iter
This repository reverses a string entered by user using the iterative approach.
We call a function to reverse a string, which iterates to every element using for loop and joins each character in the beginning so as to obtain the reversed string. 

## What is Iteration
Iterations execute a set of instructions repeatedly until some limiting criteria is met. In contrast to recursion, iteration does not require temporary memory to keep on the results of each iteration. 
Iterations are performed through ‘for’ and ‘while’ loops.
